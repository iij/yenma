* YENMA

  YENMA is a milter program for the domain authentication technologies.
  It authenticates sender's address with SPF, Sender ID, DKIM and DKIM
  ADSP, then labels the result onto the Authentication-Results: field.

  ENMA implements the following RFCs and an Internet Draft:

  - RFC4406 (Sender ID: Authenticating E-Mail)
  - RFC4407 (Purported Responsible Address)
  - RFC4408 (Sender Policy Framework, obsoleted by RFC7208)
  - RFC4871 (DKIM Signatures, obsoleted by RFC6376)
  - RFC5451 (Authentication-Results Header Field, obsoleted by RFC7001)
  - RFC5617 (ADSP)
  - RFC5672 (RFC 4871 Update, obsoleted by RFC6376)
  - RFC6376 (DKIM Signatures)
  - RFC6541 (DKIM ATPS Experiment)
  - RFC6577 (Auth-Results SPF Erratum, obsoleted by RFC7001)
  - RFC7001 (Authentication-Results Header Field)
  - RFC7208 (Sender Policy Framework)
  - RFC7489 (DMARC)

  YENMA is developed by IIJ. IIJ has been using several domain
  authentication software, though, all of them appeared unstable. YENMA
  is designed and implemented in order to stand large ISP's operation
  and is well-tested.

* Functionality

  - SPF authentication

    Yenma extracts a sender domain from SMTP MAIL FROM and looks up
    DNS. If "<>" is specified in SMTP MAIL FROM, it extracts a domain
    from SMTP EHLO/HELO. It records authentication result onto the
    Authentication-Results: field. The Received-SPF: field is not
    used.

  - Sender ID authentication

    Yenma extracts a sender domain from a mail header with RPA and
    looks up DNS. It records authentication result onto the
    Authentication-Results: field.

  - DKIM authentication

    Yenma extracts a sender domain from the DKIM-Signature field and
    looks up DNS. Then it checks the DKIM signature to verify
    authenticity of the sender domain and integrity of the mail body.
    It records authentication result onto the Authentication-Results:

  - DKIM ADSP check

    If the result of DKIM authentication is "pass" and the sender and
    the signer is the same (the From: field and the value of the "i"
    tag), Enma records "pass" without looking up DNS.

    Otherwise, it extracts a sender domain from the From: field and
    looks up DNS to obtain ADSP information, then records the
    authentication result onto the Authentication-Results: field.

  - Inserting/deleting the Authentication-Results: field

    Recording results of SPF authentication and Sender ID
    authentication onto the Authentication-Results: field. Also, to
    prevent insertion of faked Authentication-Results: fields, the
    fields which contains the hostname specified with
    authresult.identifier are deleted.
